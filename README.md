It is always painful to remember and type in the correct password in the login form while you are in development...

It would be nice to be able to login with any password in local environment and only by changing the .env variables switch to real password checking. 

(This means you do not need change your application code, when you deploy your app to production.)


Actually the behaviour of the
```php
auth()->attempt($credentials); 
```
simply changes based on the config variable in the auth.php and .env file


## Config

to  avoid accidental security vulnaribilties, 3 conditions should match before you can login with any password :

first, in your .env file you must:
```
1 - APP_ENV=local
2 - APP_DEBUG=true
```

3 - in  `config/auth.php`

and in the `auth.php` file you must change:


```php
   'driver' => 'eloquentAnyPass', // for eloquent user provider
```
  or
```php
  'driver' => 'databaseAnyPass', // for database user provider
```



 Â 
That way it is very unlikely to accidentally misconfigure your app to accept any wrong password in production.

### Note:
If for any reason, you want to keep your `APP_ENV=local` and `APP_DEBUG=true` in production, you can set `ANY_PASS=false` to forcefully turn it off and accept real passwords.
